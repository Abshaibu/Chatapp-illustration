## My process

I started with mobile view. But before that I did the entire markup first assigning different 
div's, classes and containers. Went on to style from the body to the background of the body then
 started from the very top of the design from what comes first to what follows th the next until
 i completed the project. After these i went on to look at the project and apply minor fixes to 
things I might have missed.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
