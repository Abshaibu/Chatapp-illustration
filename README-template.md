## Overview

It was fun building this even though at some point it made me nearly lose it but overall its a good challenge for people looking to boost or hone their HTML and CSS skills.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- **Bonus**: See the chat interface animate on the initial load

## My process

I started with mobile view. But before that I did the entire markup first assigning different 
div's, classes and containers. Went on to style from the body to the background of the body then
 started from the very top of the design from what comes first to what follows next until
 i completed the project. After these i went on to look at the project and apply minor fixes to 
things I might have missed.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
-Little to no Semantic
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

There is indeed no one particular method of developing a webpage/website. I also observed that patience, determination, even giving up is key to a better productivity. If all options fail when stuck on a project, ignoring that project entirely is actually a very good method of helping one resolve problems he/she might have when working.

### Continued development

-Responsive Design
-Positioning
-Mobile First Approach
-Comments
